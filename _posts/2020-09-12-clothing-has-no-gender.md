Naren writes- “I am a straight male who recently started cross dressing and I cannot begin to state how therapeutic an experience it has been for me. It helps me overcome all the insecurities I’ve been having about how I look, leaving me confident. 
> The backlash I got from people was overwhelming, to say the very least but I never let that get to me. 

People called me gay, girly and an absolute sissy. Since the day I started cross dressing to work, I’ve been stared at, excluded, called in by my boss and shouted at for not adhering to the dress code as prescribed by our workplace. That got me wondering- when a girl wears what is assumed to be a boy’s outfit, does she too face the same backlash and opposition? Why is it that we attach gender and sexuality to clothings? I have noticed that men who cross dress have more respect for women and are more appreciative of them as they know the effort, time and skill that goes into their appearance. I read somewhere once and firmly believe that your gender identity is your own. Don’t let anybody or any brand dictate to you what to do. Just be who you want to be! “ .
