Fertility & pregnancy are not easy paths for everyone and can be quite traumatic experiences for some people. Before you ask someone why they don’t have children or if they’re trying for one; take a moment to consider all the things that may be going on behind the scenes. Asking invasive questions such as these can be extremely painful when realistically you have no right to someone’s private life. Let’s be respectful of one another and create supportive environments for different people’s journeys, whatever they may be.
