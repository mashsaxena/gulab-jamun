I got into an auto after a lunch out with a friend, around 3:30 or 4pm. Out of habit, I took out a cigarette from the pack I had and lit it about five minutes after the auto started moving. I noticed the auto driver watching me in the side-view mirrors (which most autowallahs very creepily keep angled towards the inside of the auto). At one of the traffic signals, he turned around and began speaking to me. He started the conversation by asking me if I would mind countering my cigarette with him. Very reluctantly, very cautiously, I answered his questions as vaguely as I possibly could.<br>

_"Madam, do you share cigarettes with people?"_<br>
_"No, I do not."_<br>
_"So, do you study?"_<br>
_"No."_<br>
_"So then? What do you do? Do you work?"_<br>
_"Nothing anna, just drive, please."_<br>
_"Do you have a boyfriend? Or are you married?"_<br>
_"No, neither."_<br>
_"I thought a girl like you must be having many boyfriends."_<br>

It was at this moment, when I was classified by some degrading and sexist auto driver as a “girl like me”, that I texted another friend of mine about it and sent her my live location. She saw my messages a few minutes later, and instantly called me and told me to get out of that auto. We were almost a kilometre and a half away from my apartment building. I paid him and got off, waited for him to leave, and walked the rest of the way home. However, unfortunately, in those few minutes, he had forced me to give him a missed call so he would attain my phone number. I instantly blocked his number.<br>

I was uncomfortable and uneasy, but most of all I was scared. Not terrified; but scared enough to have felt the need to text a friend and walk home from a distance so that that man wouldn’t find out where I lived.
> That auto driver did not touch me. But in the way he spoke to me, prying into   personal details of my life, categorising me into a type of woman he had created in his head, the fact that he had the audacity to do all of that – I felt rather grossed out.

This is not normal. Not feeling safe even in the middle of the day, even in broad daylight, that is not normal. Unfortunately, this is the normal for most women. Most of us have felt the need to lie our ways out of unwanted situations involving men like him.
