Our founder, Amrita Nair, writes on her Facebook post- “Disclaimer- consists a few spoilers from Captain Marvel movie. So, read at your own risk.

The final “battle” in Captain Marvel was such an amazing metaphor.
Her male superior wanted her to fight (debate) him without showing emotion. He wanted her to do things according to his specific set of rules, even though they don’t make any sense. He wanted her to fulfil a specific set of criteria in order to take her seriously, even though she could do the job perfectly well. He changed the rules on her because she started winning.
And every woman, or person in any other marginalised group, knows that feeling. Of not being taken seriously in your opinions because you’re not playing by the bullshit rules that have no real meaning. Because you’re too emotional. Using your own past and experiences to fuel that emotion. And we know the feeling of being told that it’s a weakness.
In the cinema, I was worried that she was going to play by his rules. I sat, recognising that exact moment for what it was, and I was worried that she was going to give in and play by the rules he was trying to give her.
But she didn’t.
She did the perfect thing in response. She used the strength she actually had, because she’d surpassed him and it didn’t matter any more if he respected her, or if he approved. She didn’t need to play by his rules any more.
And as a woman, I really needed to see that.”
