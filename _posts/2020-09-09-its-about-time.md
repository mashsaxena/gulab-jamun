In the Movie, LOL (2012) starring Miley Cyrus and Demi Moore, there is a statement made by the ‘gran,’ (Marlo Thomas) she says “This house needs a man.” That is sexist and very heteronormative.
It is an interesting but a problematic statement, primarily for three reasons:

_A. Women to be incapable of taking care of themselves and their children, implying that women are fragile and constant need to be helped._<br>
_B. Men are a necessary element for the proper functioning of a family, and it is their duty to ensure that the family is stable. It forms an imposition on men to provide._<br>
_C. Women making this statement about women._<br>

This is caustic because patriarchy is still very evident with the constant reinforcement and lack of women solidarity.
It isn't very considerate towards the LGBTQIA++ community.
Agreed, this movie was released eight years ago, but people still consume media, irrespective of the time. In producing content where women and men are held on a pedestal with their predestined roles to be fulfilled in a heteronormative society, it is creating a society confined to patriarchy which is definitely not what we are trying to achieve, as a progressive modern society. Statements like these make a mockery out of the society.
It's 2020 now, eights years later, if time was the excuse then it's about time, to not let a structure rule people. Let's not allow patriarchy to loom and confine people in boxes, they didn't ask to be put in.
