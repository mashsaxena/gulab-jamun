Sam writes- “I wish I didn’t like cooking."

I’m a 17 year old girl in high school. I take cooking classes, French because I prefer baking to actual cooking, and love watching cooking shows. I’ve known since I was a little kid that I wanted to grow up to be a chef, and I even have papers from preschool that prove it. In my free time I play a lot of video games. Mostly csgo, which if you know anything about, you’ll know is a mostly male dominated game, like most are. But the difference with this one is the severe toxicity towards “girl gamers”. In many games I’m just seen as an outlier for being a girl, but in cs I’m a target. I’m often kicked out of games, team killed, the target of TONS of negative remarks about my skill, whether I’m top or bottom of the scoreboard, etc. But there’s one thing that has always gotten to me more than anything. And that is the comment “get back in the kitchen” / “why don’t you stop playing this game and go make me a sandwich” / “who told you you could be anything but a housewife who cooks and cleans”. Obviously those are more targeted towards the stereotypes of a stay at home wife who does everything for her husband, but as someone who just wants to go to culinary school, and has a strong passion for cooking, it’s hard to have my passion be made an attack of sorts. Because I start thinking to myself “I am in the kitchen just like they think I should be. What if that’s why I like cooking? Because I’m a girl. And girls are supposed to like it.” So there have been a lot of times where I get all giddy about getting a new stand mixer, and suddenly I have to stop and think... maybe I should do something else with my life.”
